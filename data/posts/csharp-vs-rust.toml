intro = '''
After using Rust for few months, I am in awe of the language. 
It is really different from current languages, and have lot of innovative ideas.
I am using mostly C# at my work and I often wish I could use some of the features Rust have. 
In this blog post, I will try to explain what features I would love to have in C#.
Features that Rust already have implemented.
