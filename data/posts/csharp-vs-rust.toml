intro = '''
I started writing code in Rust few months ago. 
I don't remember exactly how I learned about Rust, but I realised soon, that it is a language of the future. 
Most of new languages focus mostly on syntax, 
but Rust tries to solves problems that currently popular languages have not solve yet by exploring new ideas. 
I am using mostly C# at my work and I often wish I could use some of the features Rust have. 
I will try to present what features I miss in C# after programming in Rust for some time.
