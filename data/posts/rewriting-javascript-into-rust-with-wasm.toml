intro = '''
Wasm (Web Assembly) is a new technology allowing people to use languages other than javascript inside browser.
Wasm allows to not only use another languages but also gain performance.
Rust programming language is currently heavily investing in easy deploying wasm applications.
I decided to try rewrite my javascript front-end script with Rust and wasm and see what is possible.
