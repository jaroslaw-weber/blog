intro = '''
I started writing code in Rust few months ago. 
I don't remember exactly why I started, but I soon realised it is a language of the future. 
Most of new languages focus mostly on syntax, 
Rust tries to solves problems that currently popular languages have and explore new ideas. 
I am using mostly C# at my work and I often wish I could use some of the features Rust have. 
I will try to present what features I miss in C# after programming in Rust for some time.
